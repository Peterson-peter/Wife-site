									<h2>About Leslie Crossan M.A., M.S., CCC-SLP</h2>
									<h3>Masters Degree: Speech Language Pathology Saint Xavier University </h3>
									<h3>Masters Degree: Linguistics Northeastern Illinois University</h3>
									<p>Ten years of support with a focus on the pediatric population. I encourage my clients to find their voice and actively participate in their social world. I love what I do and am grateful to have the opportunity to make language more accessible to my clients.
										I have chosen to focus primary on dyslexia so I can make a greater impact on the children who need my services. Communication is the foundation of a fulfilling, connected life. I try to intergrate concepts related to social thinking, executive functioning, and emotion sharing into each session </p>

									<h2>Evenidence and Goal based results</h2>
									<p>As every child is different it's important to have solution-focused therapy rather than problem-solving. Clients are heavily involved when the goals are outlined and the progress is tracked as well as observed. Focus is on instilling the tools and resources patients
										need to self-solve future problems. Emphasis is placed on what is changeable and possible.</p>

									<h2>Indviual Care</h2>
									<p>As every child is different it's important to have solution-focused therapy rather than problem-solving. Clients are heavily involved when the goals are outlined and the progress is tracked as well as observed.  It's paramont to determine what type of learner an individual is
										(visual, auditory, tactile, or kinesthetic) as it is key to a successful intervention program. Complications with working memory, auditory memory, visual memory, concentration, and organization can influence how an individual learns to read and write. If there is a breakdown
										anywhere in the system, then communication disabilities can arise. The focus of treatment is on instilling the tools and resources needed to self-solve future problems.

							<h2>What we do</h2>
							<p>First is a comprehansive assement to understand where we are on the spectium of issues. After the assesment has been compelted we detail out a goal-based plan
								to specificaly highlight the areas that need improvment and provide a timeline of rehabilitation. </p>

									<h3>Dyslexia</h3>
									<p>Dyslexia is a class of learning disablility which is classified by issues with decoding, spelling and cognition of words. It is a disorder which is nuerobilogical
									in origin and is a results of a deficit in the phonological component of language. Eastside Reading Langaue therpery engages in a multi-sensory word analysis
									program reading, spelling, and vocabulary. We empower kids to learn by demystifing language strucure, spelling structure and phonoics.</p>

									<span class="icon major fa-wechat"></span>
									<h3>Articulation</h3>
									<p>As children grow they begin to develop fine moter oral movments required to produce the formation of clear and distint speech sounds. Artiucaltion colunseling is necessary
									when a child is unable to correctly produce sounds and words at the same level as his peers. Articulation error can be caused by a wide vararity of issues from touge, lip, or
									jaw movement to untreaded childhood disorders. It is vital to base treamment based on a clinical assement of the invidual child. It is much easier to correct issues during
								earily intervention rather than after languge patters have solidified.</p>

									<h3>Speech and Cognitive Assessment</h3>
									<p>Reading and speech assements are a complex processed based on the invidual. Assesing, decoding, characterizing and defining a child communication process requires the integration
									of mutiple streams of information gathered during the assessment process. The result of the assement is a combination of primarily standarized reporting and individual measurements that can be used to
								to form a corrective action plan. These assments can be used by any accredited Speech Language Pathologist to understand the nature of the indivual disability.</p>

									<h3>Literacy and Linguistics</h3>
									<p>Common and quirky words have been a part of English for so long that they no longer fit modern letter-sound correspondence. To learn how to read and spell these old, but useful words,
									we will use research based strategies to burn them into our mind’s eye, and understand how they impact grammar. Creating and using a Vowel Key to track all 18 English vowel sounds using multi-sensory techniques.
									Learning how to make non-phonetic words burn into the mind’s eye using the best research based strategies – color coding and mental imagery.</p>
